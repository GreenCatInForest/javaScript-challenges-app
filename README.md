# Set of technical exercises to highlight Vanilla JavaScript skills

## Algorithmic Challenges

### 1. Interactive Fibonacci Series Generator

#### 1.1. User Story

Create a user-friendly functional that provides an interactive experience. User should be able to input a number, and the application will generate and display the Fibonacci series up to that number.

#### 1.2.Features

1. User Input:
   Provide an input field where user can enter a number n for which they want to generate the Fibonacci series.

2. Generate Button:
   Add a "Generate" button that, when clicked, triggers the calculation of the Fibonacci series based on the user's input.
3. Display the Series:
   Show the generated Fibonacci series on the webpage in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format, such as a list or comma-separated values.

4. Series Visualization:
   Create a visual representation of the Fibonacci series, such as a bar chart or line graph, to help users understand the growth of the sequence.

#### 3. Technics, tools, frameworks

Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

### 2. Find Missing Number

#### 2.1. User Story

         Write a functional for the app that takes an array of integers containing numbers from 1 to n (where one number is missing) and returns the missing number.

         Example: findMissingNumber([1, 2, 4, 5, 6]);
         // Output: 3
