### Algorithmic Challenges

#### 1. Interactive Fibonacci Series Generator

      Develop a user-friendly web application that provides an interactive experience.

      Users should be able to input a number, and the application will generate and display the Fibonacci series up to that number.

      Features:

      User Input:
      Provide an input field where user can enter a number n for which they want to generate the Fibonacci series.

      Generate Button:
      Add a "Generate" button that, when clicked, triggers the calculation of the Fibonacci series based on the user's input.

      Display the Series:
      Show the generated Fibonacci series on the webpage in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format, such as a list or comma-separated values.

      Series Visualization:
      Create a visual representation of the Fibonacci series, such as a bar chart or line graph, to help users understand the growth of the sequence.

      Example: fibonacciSeries(8);
      // Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]


#### 2. Find Missing Number

         Write a functional for the app that takes an array of integers containing numbers from 1 to n (where one number is missing) and returns the missing number.

         Example: findMissingNumber([1, 2, 4, 5, 6]);
         // Output: 3
